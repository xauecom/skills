# xauecom/skills

A collection of reusable [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) for AI coding agents.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add xauecom/skills
```

Or manually copy the desired skill folder into your agent's skills directory.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [xaut-trade](skills/xaut-trade/) | Buy or sell XAUT (Tether Gold) on Ethereum via Uniswap V3 and UniswapX |

## Creating a New Skill

1. Copy the [template](template/SKILL.md) into a new directory under `skills/`:

```bash
cp -r template skills/my-new-skill
```

2. Edit `skills/my-new-skill/SKILL.md`:
   - Set `name` to match the directory name (lowercase, hyphens only)
   - Write a clear `description` of what the skill does and when to use it
   - Add instructions in the Markdown body

3. Optionally add supporting files:
   - `references/` — additional documentation loaded on demand
   - `scripts/` — executable code the agent can run
   - `assets/` — templates, images, data files
